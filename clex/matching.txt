ClEx pattern: abc(def)ghi

Broken down:

Root["abc", Group["def"], "ghi"]

(do note that "abc" actually means 'a', 'b', 'c')

No continuations.

Pattern: abc([def])ghi

Root["abc", Group[Set["d", "e", "f"]], "ghi"]

Set requires continuation.

Start matching on root. Reaches group, group sees set requires continuation,
thus group needs continuation. Group gets called with next. Set attempts each
element with continuation.
